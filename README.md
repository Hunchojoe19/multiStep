# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Project Title

MULTI-STEP INPUT FORM

## Description

This project is a multi-step input field component built using React js and Redux for state management. It provides a seamless way for users to input data across multiple steps/forms within a single interface.

## Goals

The aim of this project to is to create a seamless and user-friendly multi-step input field component that can be easily integrated into any React application.

## Problem Statement

Traditional single-page forms can be overwhelming for users, especially when they involve a lot of input fields. Multi-step forms help break down the process into smaller, more manageable chunks, reducing user fatigue and improving the overall user experience. However, implementing such forms efficiently, especially in complex applications, can be challenging.

## Solution

This project offers a reusable solution for implementing multi-step input forms in React applications. By leveraging Redux for state management, it ensures consistent state handling across different steps, making it easier to manage user input throughout the form submission process.

## Features

1.Step-by-Step Interface: Guides users through the input process with clear step indicators.
2.Redux-Powered State Management: Utilizes Redux for efficient state management, ensuring data integrity and consistency across steps.
4.Validation Support: Includes validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and accuracy before submission.
5.Error Handling: Provides robust error handling capabilities to notify users of any issues during the input process.
6.Responsive Design: Responsive layout ensures compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies

React js, Tailwind, Vite, Redux/Redux toolkit
